### Map Exercises

1. **Double Then Square**: Given a list of numbers, use `map` to double each number and then square it.
    ```python
    # Input: [1, 2, 3]
    # Output: [4, 16, 36]
    ```

2. **Reverse Strings**: Given a list of strings, use `map` to reverse each string.
    ```python
    # Input: ['apple', 'banana']
    # Output: ['elppa', 'ananab']
    ```

### Filter Exercises

3. **Filter Strings with Vowels**: Given a list of strings, use `filter` to return a new list containing only the strings that contain at least one vowel.
    ```python
    # Input: ['sky', 'apple', 'try']
    # Output: ['apple']
    ```

4. **Filter Multiples of N**: Given a list of numbers and a number `N`, use `filter` to return a new list containing only the numbers that are multiples of `N`.
    ```python
    # Input: [10, 15, 20, 25], N=5
    # Output: [10, 15, 20, 25]
    ```

### Reduce Exercises

5. **Find Maximum Length**: Given a list of strings, use `reduce` to find the length of the longest string in the list.
    ```python
    # Input: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
    # Output: 6
    ```

6. **Sum of Squares**: Given a list of numbers, use `reduce` to find the sum of the squares of all the numbers in the list.
    ```python
    # Input: [1, 2, 3, 4]
    # Output: 30
    ```
