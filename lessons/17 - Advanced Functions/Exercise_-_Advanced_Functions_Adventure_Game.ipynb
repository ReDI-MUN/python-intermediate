    "# Exercise - Adventure Game Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  `Player` class: A class representing the player of the game. This class should have the following methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "    *   `__init__(self, name, health, stamina)`: A constructor that takes the player's name, health, and stamina as arguments.\n",
    "    *   `attack(self, weapon)`: A method that takes a weapon object as an argument and returns a damage value.\n",
    "    *   `heal(self, heal_amount)`: A method that takes a heal amount as an argument and increases the player's health by that amount.\n",
    "2.  `Weapon` class: A class representing a weapon that the player can use. This class should have the following methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "    *   `__init__(self, name, damage)`: A constructor that takes the weapon's name and damage value as arguments.\n",
    "    *   `upgrade(self, upgrade_amount)`: A method that takes an upgrade amount as an argument and increases the weapon's damage by that amount.\n",
    "3.  `Enemy` class: A class representing an enemy that the player will face. This class should have the following methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "    *   `__init__(self, name, health, attack)`: A constructor that takes the enemy's name, health, and attack value as arguments.\n",
    "    *   `take_damage(self, damage)`: A method that takes a damage value as an argument and decreases the enemy's health by that amount.\n",
    "    *   `is_dead(self)`: A method that returns `True` if the enemy's health is less than or equal to 0, and `False` otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advanced Functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Decorators:\n",
    "\n",
    "    *   `@debug`: A decorator that prints the name of the method being called along with its arguments before executing the method.\n",
    "    *   `@retry`: A decorator that retries the function if it raises an exception. The decorator should take the number of retries as an argument.\n",
    "2.  Lambda Functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "    *   `is_critical_hit`: A lambda function that takes a player object and a weapon object as arguments and returns `True` if the player's stamina is greater than or equal to 10, and the weapon's damage is greater than or equal to 20.\n",
    "3.  Closures:\n",
    "\n",
    "    *   `add_bonus_damage`: A closure function that takes a weapon object and returns a function that adds a bonus damage value to the weapon's damage.\n",
    "4.  Generator Functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "    *   `enemy_generator`: A generator function that generates a sequence of random enemy objects. The generator should yield one enemy at a time.\n",
    "5.  Variable Arguments Functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "    *   `battle`: A variable arguments function that simulates a battle between the player and enemy objects. The function should take one player object and one or more enemy objects as arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Implement the classes and advanced functions described above.\n",
    "2.  Test your implementation by creating instances of the `Player`, `Weapon`, and `Enemy` classes, calling the methods, and utilizing the advanced function concepts.\n",
    "3.  Make sure to use appropriate syntax and naming conventions for each concept."
