This is useful in scenarios where different projects require different versions of packages or even different versions of Python itself. By using virtual environments, you can ensure that the packages installed for one project do not interfere with the packages installed for another."

    "`pyenv` and `virtualenv` are two different tools that serve related but distinct purposes in Python development. Here's how they relate to each other:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **`pyenv`:** This is a tool that lets you easily switch between multiple versions of Python. It provides access to different Python interpreters (like CPython, PyPy, etc.) and various versions of these interpreters. `pyenv` works by modifying the `PATH` environment variable to point to the Python version you've selected to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **`virtualenv`:** This is a tool that lets you create isolated Python environments. Each `virtualenv` has its own Python binaries (which are linked back to the version of Python `virtualenv` was created with) and can have its own independent set of installed Python packages. This allows you to have multiple isolated Python environments on the same computer, each potentially using different versions of packages, without conflicts.\n",
