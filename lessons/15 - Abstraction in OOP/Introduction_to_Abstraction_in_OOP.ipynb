    "## Introduction to Abstraction in OOP\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction is an important concept in object-oriented programming (OOP). It involves representing complex real-world entities as simpler, more abstract models that capture the essential characteristics of those entities. This helps to simplify the code and make it more modular, reusable, and maintainable.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will explore abstraction in OOP using Python. Specifically, we will look at how to use abstract classes and methods to implement abstraction in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Abstract Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated on its own. It is used as a base class for other classes to inherit from, and it contains one or more abstract methods that the inheriting classes must implement. Abstract classes are used to define a set of common behaviors that all the inheriting classes must adhere to.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create an abstract class in Python, we use the `abc` module, which provides a `ABC` (Abstract Base Class) class that we can inherit from. Here is an example of an abstract class `Animal` that has an abstract method `make_sound()`:"
