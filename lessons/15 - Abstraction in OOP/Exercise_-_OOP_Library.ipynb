    "# Object-Oriented Library Exercise\n",
    "Suppose you are designing a simple library management system. The system has several types of materials, including books, magazines, and DVDs. Each material has a title, an author or director, and a unique identifier. However, each material has different rules for checking out and returning.\n"
   ]

   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "1.  **Create a Base Class - Material:** Define a base class named `Material` with the following attributes and methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "    *   Properties: `title` (string), `creator` (string), and `identifier` (integer).\n",
    "    *   Methods: \n",
    "        * `checkout(user_id: str)` which updates the material's status to checked out and assigns the user\\_id to it. If the material is already checked out, the method should not allow another checkout and should return an appropriate message. \n",
    "        * `return_material()` resets the material's status to available and removes the user\\_id from it. If the material is not checked out, the method should return an appropriate message.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Define Subclasses - Book and Magazine:** Create two subclasses of `Material`, namely `Book` and `Magazine`.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *   The `Book` class should have an extra property for the `number of pages`.\n",
    "    *   The `Magazine` class should have an extra property for the `publication date`.\n",
    "    *   The `Book` class should override the `checkout` method to restrict each user to check out only one book at a time. If a user attempts to check out more than one book, the method should return an appropriate message.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Define Subclass - DVD:** Create another subclass of `Material`, called `DVD`.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *   The `DVD` class should have an extra property for the `length of the video`.\n",
    "    *   The `DVD` class should override the `checkout` method to restrict each user to check out only one DVD at a time. Also, if the DVD is returned past the due date, a late fee should be added. The due date is calculated as 7 days from the checkout date. The late fee is calculated as $1 per day overdue.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Create an Abstract Class - User:** Define an abstract class named `User` with the following methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "    *   Methods: \n",
    "        * `check_material(material: Material)` which checks if the user has already checked out any material. If yes, it does not allow another checkout and returns an appropriate message. \n",
    "        * `return_material(material: Material)` checks if the user has checked out the material and if yes, allows it to be returned. If the material is not checked out by the user, it returns an appropriate message.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Define Subclasses - Student and Faculty:** Create two subclasses of `User`, namely `Student` and `Faculty`.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *   The `Student` class should have an extra property for the `student ID`.\n",
    "    *   The `Faculty` class should have an extra property for the `department`.\n",
    "    *   The `Faculty` class should override the `check_material` method to allow a longer checkout period compared to the `Student` class. The checkout period for faculty is 14 days.\n",
    "    \n",
    "6.  **Create a Library Class:** Define a `Library` class that holds properties for the materials and users in the library.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *   This class should also have methods for adding and removing materials and users, as well as for searching for materials by title or identifier. The search should return all materials that match the search query and an appropriate message if no matches are found.\n",
    "    \n",
    "7.  **Instantiate and Test:** Finally, create instances of the `Book`, `Magazine`, `DVD`, `Student`, and `Faculty` classes. Add these instances to an instance of the `Library` class. Test the `checkout` and `return` methods with different materials and users to ensure the system works as expected."
