    "## Methods\n",
    "In object-oriented programming, methods of a class are used to define behaviors that are associated with objects of that class. Methods are similar to functions, but are defined within a class and can access the class's instance variables and other methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, methods can have different access modifiers: public, private, and protected. Additionally, there are special types of methods, such as class methods and static methods.\n",

    "Public methods are accessible from any part of the code. In Python, there is no strict enforcement of public methods; they are usually denoted by their simple name.\n",

    "Private methods are meant to be accessed only from within the class. In Python, we use name mangling to denote private methods by prefixing them with two underscores `__`.\n",

    "Protected methods are meant to be accessed within the class and its subclasses but can still be accessed outside the class if necessary. In Python, there is no strict enforcement of protected methods. They are denoted by prefixing the method name with a single underscore `_`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Static Methods\n",
    "Static methods are methods that belong to a class rather than an instance and don't have access to instance or class variables. They are independent of the class's state and are defined using the `@staticmethod` decorator. Static methods are useful when you have a utility function that doesn't depend on the state of the class or its instances. Since static methods don't require an instance of the class, they can be called on the class itself, rather than an object of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Class Methods\n",
    "Class methods are methods that are bound to the class and not the instance. They can access and modify class-level variables, and they take a reference to the class itself as their first argument, typically named cls. Class methods are defined using the `@classmethod` decorator. These methods are useful when you want to perform an action that is related to the class, rather than a specific instance. Like static methods, class methods can also be called on the class itself without creating an instance of the class."
