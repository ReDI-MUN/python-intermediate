    "## 1. What is Object-Oriented Programming?\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that emphasizes the use of objects and their interactions to design and develop software. OOP is based on the idea of objects, which can contain data (called attributes) and code (called methods), and the interaction between them. OOP allows you to organize code into reusable components and make it easier to maintain and modify."

    "## 2. Basic Concepts of Object-Oriented Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classes and Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects, while an object is an instance of a class. In OOP, a class defines the data and behavior of its objects. The data is represented by attributes (also known as fields or properties), and the behavior is represented by methods (also known as functions).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Attributes and Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Attributes are the data members (variables) of a class, while methods are the functions that can access and modify these data members. Attributes can be thought of as the nouns of a class, while methods can be thought of as the verbs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Encapsulation\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit called a class. This provides a way to hide the data and methods from outside code, and only allow access through a defined set of methods, which can help prevent unwanted modifications to the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance is the process by which one class inherits the properties (attributes and methods) of another class. The class that is being inherited from is called the parent or base class, while the class that inherits from the base class is called the child or derived class. Inheritance allows you to create new classes based on existing classes, and to reuse code and data without having to rewrite it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Polymorphism\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms. In OOP, polymorphism allows you to create objects that can be treated as if they are of multiple types. Polymorphism is closely related to inheritance, as it allows you to use a derived class object wherever a base class object is expected."

    "### Exercise: Convert the Zoo Management System to Object-Oriented Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will convert the given procedural program for a zoo management system into an object-oriented program. The procedural program consists of a list of animals and several functions to manage the animals in the zoo.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to apply the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP) to redesign and re-implement the zoo management system. Follow the instructions below to complete the exercise:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Design classes**: Identify the classes you need to create for the zoo management system. For example, you might create an `Animal` class and a `Zoo` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Define attributes and methods**: Determine the attributes and methods required for each class. Make sure to consider encapsulation when designing your classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Implement class constructors**: Write the `__init__` method for each class, which initializes the attributes with the provided arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Convert functions to class methods**: Transform the procedural functions (e.g., `add_animal`, `get_animal`, `remove_animal`, and `print_animal`) into class methods. Ensure that each method operates on the class's attributes and follows OOP principles.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Create objects**: Replace the global list `zoo_animals` with an object representing the zoo. Create animal objects and add them to the zoo object.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.  **Test your implementation**: Test your OOP implementation by performing the same actions as in the procedural example (adding animals, getting animals, and removing animals). Verify that your implementation produces the same results.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As you work through the exercise, keep the following OOP concepts in mind:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Encapsulation**: Bundle related data and functions together within classes, and use access control to restrict access to certain attributes or methods.\n",
    "*   **Inheritance**: If applicable, consider creating subclasses for different animal species or categories to reuse and extend the code.\n",
    "*   **Polymorphism**: Implement methods that can operate on multiple types or classes of objects, if applicable.\n",
    "\n",
    "After completing this exercise, you should have a better understanding of how to design and implement object-oriented programs in Python."
